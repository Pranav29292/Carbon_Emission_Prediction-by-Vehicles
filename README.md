# 🚗 Vehicle CO₂ Emission Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts CO₂ emissions from vehicles using Machine Learning and compares Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Hybrid, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) to support eco-friendly decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict CO₂ emissions for ICE vehicles  
- Compare emissions with Hybrid and Electric Vehicles  
- Recommend the best low-emission vehicle option  

## 📊 Dataset
- 30,000+ records  
- Features:  
  - Engine Size (L)  
  - Fuel Consumption (L/100 km)  
- Target:  
  - CO₂ Emissions (g/km)  
- Machine Learning is applied only to ICE vehicles  
- EV emissions are calculated analytically  

## 🤖 Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest (**Final Selected Model**)  

## 📈 Visualizations
- CO₂ Emission Comparison (Bar Graph)  
- CO₂ Emission Trend vs Distance (Line Graph)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit, GitHub
